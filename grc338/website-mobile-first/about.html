<h2>About Us</h2>

<img src="about.jpg" alt="Green Eats">

<p>At Green Eats we believe you are what you eat. We use fresh, locally sourced, organic ingredients to provide our community with nutritious plates. Pastries are baked in-house and fresh bread is delivered daily. We source our produce from Apricot Lanes Farm, a family farm located in Moorpark, CA.</p> 

<p>Green Eats started in 2012 as a take-away stand in El Porto and has since grown to serve the entire South Bay community. The team at Green Eats is passionate about friendly service, delicious coffee and great food.</p>
